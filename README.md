Recently my friend presented me a couple of smart cameras from some well known manufacture, and I got an idea. 

How is it complex to build yours? 
I had Raspberry Pi Camera and decided to investigate what software and components do I need to build my own smart camera. 
I checked several projects and decided to enhance my project with touch screen to control camera, simple motion detection and cloud storage support. 
And an optional bonus if you need it: OpenCV face recognition.
